# Advent of Code 2024

This repository hosts my solutions for the annual Advent of Code challenge.
I am choosing to use Rust this year.

## Requirements

Your system simply needs to have Rust installed.

## Running

After cloning the repository you can run the solution for a given day with the following command

```bash
cargo run --bin dayXX
```

Where `XX` is the intended day. For example, the 1st day is simply `day01`.
